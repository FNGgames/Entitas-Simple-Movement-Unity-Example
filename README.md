# Entitas-Simple-Movement-Unity-Example
Entitas Unity project to illustrate several simple concepts such as rendering and movement.

Text tutorial coming soon.

Topics covered:

1. Examples of simple "View" Systems to render entities with Unity GameObjects, synchronising the position and rotation of the gameobject with the entity's component data using Reactive Systems.
2. Listening for Unity mouse input and transmitting it to Entitas as Components.
3. A System for issuing movement commands to entities and a (very) simple AI System to act on those commands, moving entities around on screen.
